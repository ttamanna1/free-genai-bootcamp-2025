Pay attention to how to express possession or location clearly.

## Student input: Di mana boleh saya cari sebuah riben kecil merah jambu kunin ini kedai?

Interpretation of Your Sentence

Your sentence says:
"Where can I find a small pink yellow this shop ribbon?"

Feedback:
1. Word Order:
- The phrase "riben kecil merah jambu kunin ini kedai" is slightly jumbled. Adjectives should follow the noun in the correct sequence, but the placement of "ini kedai" (this shop) is incorrect.
2. Missing Article:
- The article "di" (in/at) is missing before "kedai" to indicate the location properly.
3. Adjective Agreement:
- The spelling of "kunin" should be corrected to "kuning" for "yellow."

Suggested Adjustments

Focus on these points:

1. Place "di" before "kedai" to indicate location.
2. Correct "kunin" to "kuning."
3. Consider rearranging "ini kedai" to "di kedai ini" to make the sentence clearer.
